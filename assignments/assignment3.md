# CSE410 - Assignment 3
## Due: 9/24/2019 17:00

This assignment will cover Data Center Security principles and will be a chance
for you perform a mock security audit.

This assignment can be submitted by committing an updated version of this file
to your course repo under an 'assignments' folder. It can be in its own markdown
file, or as the README of its own folder depending on your preference.

4. What is Defense in Depth? Why is it so important when planning your security?

5. What are some common security oversights? How can they be used to bypass
   security measures?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. (5 pts) Take a walk around campus and try to identify 5 different examples of
   potential security oversights or examples of where steps have been taken to
   mitigate common oversights. Take a photo of each example and explain how it
   could potentially be used to bypass security measures or how it mitigates a
   common attack vector. <strong>Do not test to see if you can exploit these oversights, do not post potential oversights to public forums, and do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to locations. This is intended to get you looking for these things in your day to day - not turn you into the next Kevin Mitnick.</strong>
