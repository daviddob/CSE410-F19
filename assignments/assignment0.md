# CSE410 - Assignment 0 
## Due: 9/10/2019 18:00

This introductory assignment will serve to get partnerships established as well
as get GitHub repositories set up for use in future assignments. This assignment
will get us rolling for the rest of the semester.

## 1. Partners

The assignments and labs for this course will be performed in pairs (similar to
the [pair programming concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)).
Your partner is there to bounce ideas off of, troubleshoot with, and help share
the workload.

When selecting a partner for this course, it may be beneficial to find someone
with similar interests in systems to run on your shared hardware. That said, as
this is an academic course, it is also important to select a partner who is
interested in achieving the same grade as you. 

While the partner system allows for sharing of responsibility and workload, it
is **not acceptable for one student to perform all the work**. If you fear that
this is becoming the case, please address this with your partner and/or myself via
email or Slack as the semester progresses. *Note: quizzes may be based on lab
material as well, so ensure both partners understand the implementation and
concepts!*

If you are looking for a partner, feel free to reach out on Slack or after class
to get paired up. Once you have found a partner, proceed to step 2 below.

## 2. GitHub Repository

For the majority of this course we will be using GitHub repositories to track
lab documentation in markdown files, store configuration, and submit
assignments. This is how many open-source and enterprise projects handle
documentation, so it'll be a good practice to get used to. While GitHub does have
a Wiki function built in, it is technically a separate embedded repo and doesn't
have the best hierarchy support, so for simplicity sake we will be using plain
markdown and [README](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes) files.

### 2.1 GitHub Educational Pack

GitHub has a pretty solid [Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
full of pro features and partnership programs with other companies that allow
you free access to tools for devops, monitoring, CI/CD, Agile Tracking, and
more. GitHub recently made private repos free for up to 3 collaborators, however
we may take advantage of some of the other educational pack perks (say that
three times fast) later in the semester.

If you have not already registered for the educational pack, take a few minutes
to do that now - it is usually approved within a few days.

### 2.2 Create a repository

Create a **Private** GitHub repository for use in this course; initialize it
with a README and a description. Then invite your partner and me
([@daviddob](https://github.com/daviddob)) as collaborators to
the repository. 

## 3. Submit!

Fill out the following Google Form with your partner information and a
link to the GitHub repository.
