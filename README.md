Incompletes (I/IU)*: A grade of incomplete (“I”) indicates that additional
course work is required to fulfill the requirements of a given course. Students
may only be given an “I” grade if they have a passing average in coursework that
has been completed and they have well-defined parameters to complete the course
requirements that could result in a grade better than the default grade. An “I”
grade may not be assigned to a student who did not attend the course. Prior to
the end of the semester, students must initiate the request for an “I” grade and
receive the instructor’s approval. Assignment of an “I” grade is at the
discretion of the instructor.

## Late Policy

Late submissions will be accepted with a penalty of 25% per day the submission is
late. A day is considered as 24hrs passed the deadline. i.e If a submission is
5 hours late it is -25%, 30 hours late it is -50%, and so forth up to a maximum
of 95hrs 59mins past the deadline. If you are submitting late, you must notify
me via Slack when you have completed the assignment.

## Additional Academic Content
Aside from the assignments and projects, there is no activity required outside
of class (i.e. there are no field trips, readings, additional related lectures,
etc).  However, completion of the assignments and projects will likely require
independent research and reading outside of class time.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is a fundamental university value. Through the honest completion of academic work, students sustain the integrity of the university while facilitating the university's imperative for the transmission of knowledge and culture based upon the generation of new and innovative ideas.
 
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course and may result in grade
reductions, failed assignments, failed classes, or expulsion from UB according
to the university and CSE policies.

No behavior that compromises academic honesty (such as use of someone else's work or code, using prohibited materials during tests, or making your work available to others) will be tolerated in this course. You are expected to complete assignments on your own. You are encouraged to collaborate on the approach and discuss ideas to complete assignments, however, it is essential that you complete all programming and writing assignments on your own. The submitted assignments will be checked for plagiarism, which will be triggered by programs written in close collaboration. It is expected that your work represents your own understanding of the problem. If work of others is used, it must be properly cited. Use of properly cited material is acceptable, but no referencing is treated as claiming the work as your own. If you need assistance with anything, do not hesitate to contact the instructor.
